## Nonparametric simultaneous tolerance intervals

### To do:

- [ ] Review lognormal and normal  
- [ ] Rewrite the codes to make them readable  
- [ ] Multivariate 2-sided intervals: Try reproducing for other means and variance covariance matrices (started)
- [ ] Univariate 2-sided intervals: Try reproducing for other means and variance covariance matrices
